# Project Mundus Launcher

Desktop launcher for the Project Mundus SkyMP server. Handles Discord authentication, client file installation, mod management via Mod Organizer 2, and launching Skyrim through SKSE.
Original by the SkyMP team: https://github.com/F02K/SkyMP-Launcher

Pre-built installers are available at **https://projectmundus.com/**.

## Instructions

1) Open the Server Manager (server-manager) and go to the Launcher tab
2) Set the version if needed, then click "Rebuild"
3) Collect the installer from build\launcher\MundusLauncherSetup.exe (already named for distribution)
4) nginx is already set up to route api.projectmundus.com/download/MundusLauncherSetup.exe, change this as needed
5) Whenever you edit these files, rebuild from the Launcher tab. Also, check the Backend readme.md for more.

## Project structure

```
src/
  main.js          Main process: window, IPC handlers, OAuth flow, install, launch
  preload.js       Context-isolated bridge - exposes window.electronAPI to renderer
  config.js        API_URL from env (defaults to https://api.projectmundus.com)
  mo2.js           Mod Organizer 2 portable install + manifest replay
  nexus.js         Nexus Mods API (key validation, premium downloads, SSO)
  ini.js           Minimal INI reader/writer for SkyrimPrefs.ini
  gameversion.js   SkyrimSE.exe version gate (1.6.1170.0) + Reliquary downgrade popup
  renderer/
    index.html     UI shell: topbar, content grid, modals
    renderer.js    Event listeners, API calls, settings, news/modlist rendering
    styles.css     Dark theme, glass effects, custom fonts
assets/            App icon (icon.ico), background.gif, controlmap.txt
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm start        # or npm run dev
```

Runs with `--dev` flag: DevTools open, loads `.env` from project root.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `API_URL` if pointing at a local backend:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build:win    # Windows - NSIS installer (x64), the supported target
npm run build        # electron-builder default
```

The app is Windows-only in practice (tasklist process detection, reg.exe nxm
handler, NSIS installer, MO2, LOCALAPPDATA paths). The `build:linux`/`build:mac`
scripts and their config blocks are present but need platform icons added first.

Output goes to `../build/launcher` (see `directories.output` in package.json).

### Client settings file format

Offline mode (server `offlineMode: true`):
```json
{
  "server-ip": "...",
  "server-port": 7777,
  "master": "",
  "server-master-key": null,
  "gameData": { "profileId": 12345 }
}
```

Online mode (server `offlineMode: false`):
```json
{
  "server-ip": "...",
  "server-port": 7777,
  "master": "https://api.projectmundus.com/",
  "server-master-key": "<key>"
}
```
In online mode the session credentials are written separately to
`Data/Platform/PluginsNoLoad/auth-data-no-load.js` so the in-game SkyMP client
skips its own Discord OAuth dialog.

## Game version

The client is built against Skyrim SE/AE **1.6.1170.0** (Steam). `gameversion.js`
reads the FileVersion straight out of `SkyrimSE.exe` (pure node PE parser, no
process spawn) and the launcher checks it at startup, before the portable game
copy is created, and on every launch path via `prepareForLaunch`. Any other
build opens a "Wrong Skyrim version" popup with a button to the Reliquary
downgrade tool (https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/2188?tab=description) and
blocks the launch; the renderer warning strip shows the same message. GOG
installs (Galaxy64.dll / goggame-* present) are accepted at **1.6.1179.0**, the
GOG build of the same generation. An unreadable version never blocks, it is
only logged.

## Repair tab

Settings > Repair replaces the old Installation tab. Every button fully
reinstalls its section (`{ force: true }` over the same IPC as the Play-button
install): **Repair MO2** wipes MO2's own files (mods, downloads, profiles, the
game copy and the instance inis stay) and unpacks it again, **Repair Game Copy**
re-copies every vanilla file, **Repair SKSE** re-downloads the archive and
replaces the root files, **Repair Client Files** re-downloads the client zip,
**Repair Modlist** rebuilds every mod from the install manifest. **Repair All**
chains them in that order; **Check Files** (`install:check`) is a read-only scan
that lists every missing/corrupt/extra/outdated file with the button that fixes
it. It compares client files by size + sha256 when `/api/files/version` carries
the `files[]` list written by the backend's `npm run merge`.
